# GameThink

A text based adventure game maker. For Swamphacks 2018. Unfinished.

## Inspiration

Zork and countless other text based adventures that have inspired creativity and a love for computing.

## What it does

At the moment, not much. We have sketches of a future polished user interface and a very rough prototype of the game creation web app.

## How we built it

We used React and TypeScript./JavaScript.

## Challenges we ran into

We only had minimal experience with React previously, and spent most of out time learning about it (the hard way). In particular we had issues accepting user input, which delayed work on other crucial parts of the app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We made it through SwampHacks.

## What we learned

We would of been more successful if before coming we had worked through some basic React and TypeScript apps to understand the framework better and avoid many little problems.

## What's next for GameThink

The Open Source Club at UF may adopt it and turn it into a full fledged application with the objective of helping both to create new and exciting adventure games and help teach programming concepts at outreach events.

Note: To quickly remove security issues (and the GitHub security notifications) from old dependence, the packages have been upgraded without testing the code. As this is an inactive project, we felt this was acceptable. If the project receives interest in the future, the code could be rolled back if there were problems.
